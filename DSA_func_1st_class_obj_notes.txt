#Functions as first class objects
1.Created at runtime
2.Assigned as a variable or in a data structure
3.Passed as an argument to a function
4.Returned as the result of a function

Functions that take other functions as arguments, or that return functions, are called higher order functions
Python 3 has two order function
1 filter()-
2.map()-

n/b-A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
n/b -use list comprehensions over the built in functions above because list comprehensions are easy to read
n/b- diff between list.sort() method and sorted functions is that the list.sort method sorts the existing instance of the list without copying it
